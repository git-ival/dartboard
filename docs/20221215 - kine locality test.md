# 2022-12-15 - Kine locality test

## Results

No significant difference in list performance of small ConfigMaps, up to 256K of them, running Kine:
 - on the same machine running Postgres
 - or inside of the k3s cluster, with Postgres running in RDS

(machine running Postgres is set up on Amazon Linux, using the same Postgres version as RDS and the same virtual hardware to make the comparison as fair as possible)

[Details in Excel format](https://mysuse-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/moio_suse_com/EW4-iiB6Ib5PoMHO_Am6m_4BAISQCb7ozW5BwDx_ACMpfQ) are available to SUSE employees.

## Methodology notes

- no workload is running on the local cluster, no downstream clusters are registered
- every measurement is repeated 10 times and average/standard deviation is calculated. All standard deviations observed appeared to be reasonable to sustain conclusions above
- API calls under benchmark are accessed via pure REST, setup calls use a Kubernetes client
- all request responses are checked for errors (non-200 return codes). All results with errors were discarded, conclusions above use non-error cases only
- pauses are used before running each benchmark to ensure previous operations do not interfere (eg. handlers triggered asynchronously after resource creation)
- entire environment is destroyed and recreated via Terraform for each test

## Test outline
- infrastructure is set up:
    - AWS hardware (VMs, network devices, databases...) are deployed
    - k3s is installed on cluster nodes
- test is conducted:
    - the benchmark script is run (see below)
    - results are collected in CSV form and elaborated in Excel

## Full configuration details

All infrastructure is defined via [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) files in the [20221215_kine_locality_test](https://github.com/rancher/dartboard/tree/20221215_kine_locality_test/terraform) branch.
Benchmark Python script is available in the [util](https://github.com/rancher/dartboard/tree/20221215_kine_locality_test/util) directory.

## Reproduction Instructions

### Requirements

- API access to EC2 configured for your terminal
    - for SUSE Engineering:
        - [have "AWS Landing Zone" added to your Okta account](https://confluence.suse.com/display/CCOE/Requesting+AWS+Access)
        - open [Okta](https://suse.okta.com/) -> "AWS Landing Zone"
        - Click on "AWS Account" -> your account -> "Command line or programmatic access" -> click to copy commands under "Option 1: Set AWS environment variables"
        - paste contents in terminal
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
- `git`
- `nc` (netcat)

### Setup

- clone this project:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/rancher/dartboard.git
cd scalability-tests
git checkout 20221215_kine_locality_test
```
- initialize Terraform and Cypress:
```shell
cd terraform
terraform init
```

### Run

Configure and deploy the AWS infrastructure:
  - edit `terraform/inputs.tf` (specifically: `ssh_private_key_path`, `ssh_public_key_path`)
  - deploy and configure infrastructure:
```shell
terraform apply
```

Execute the benchmark:
```shell
./config/ssh-to-upstream-server-node-0-*.sh KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml python3 - 0 1000 256000 10 4 <./util/benchmark_k8s_config_maps.py | tee -a results.csv
```

Elements of the line above have the following meaning:
 - `./config/ssh-to-upstream-server-node-0-*.sh` opens an SSH shell to the first server node of the cluster
 - `KUBECONFIG` points to the configuration file on the first cluster node
 - `0 1000 256000` indicate the number of resources to create before each benchmark measure - starting from 0, first step at 1000, doubling the number up to 256000
 - `10 4` indicate the number of repetitions for each benchmark and the number of bytes in the configmap data field respectively
 - `./util/benchmark_k8s_config_maps.py` is the benchmark script
 - `| tee -a results.csv` saves results into a file that can be opened in a spreadsheet editor

The benchmark can be repeated after reverting the "Switch back to RDS backed kine" commit to observe the difference between the two environments.

### Cleanup

All created infrastructure can be destroyed via:
```shell
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```
